Choose K centroids randomly.\n","2. Assign each point to the nearest centroid.\n","3. Update centroids by calculating mean of assigned points.\n","4. Repeat until centroids don’t change.\n","\n","**Best For:** Clearly separated circular clusters.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🔸 b. **Hierarchical Clustering**\n","\n","* Builds a **tree (dendrogram)** of clusters.\n","* Doesn’t require K initially.\n","\n","**Two Types:**\n","\n","* **Agglomerative:** Bottom-up (each point is a cluster, merge upward).\n","* **Divisive:** Top-down (start as one big cluster, split down).\n","\n","**Best For:** Understanding **cluster relationships** and hierarchy.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🔸 c. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**\n","\n","* Groups points that are **close together (dense regions)**.\n","* Can detect **arbitrary-shaped** clusters.\n","* Identifies **outliers** (noise).\n","\n","**Best For:** Clustering with **noise** and **non-spherical** shapes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🔸 d. **Mean Shift**\n","\n","* Finds **dense areas** (modes) in feature space.\n","* Does **not require K**.\n","* Shifts centroid toward the highest data density.\n","\n","**Best For:** Adaptive clustering when the number of clusters is unknown.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🧠 Summary Table: Clustering Algorithms\n","\n","| Algorithm    | Needs K? | Handles Noise | Handles Irregular Shapes | Type           |\n","| ------------ | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |\n","| K-Means      | ✅ Yes    | ❌ No          | ❌ No                     | Centroid-based |\n","| Hierarchical | ❌ No     | ❌ Limited     | ❌ Limited                | Tree-based     |\n","| DBSCAN       | ❌ No     | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes                    | Density-based  |\n","| Mean Shift   | ❌ No     | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes                    | Density-based  |\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 🔹 2.
