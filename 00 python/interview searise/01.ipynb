Python uses dynamic typing, so you don’t declare types — you just assign values. Variable names must follow identifier rules and cannot be keywords. Python stores variables as references to objects, and unused objects are cleaned up by the garbage collector.\n","\n","---\n","\n","If you want, I can next give you a **memory model diagram** showing exactly what happens in Python when you create and assign variables — this will make you stand out in an interview.
